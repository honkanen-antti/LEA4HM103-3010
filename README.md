# Reflective Leadership (course LEA4HM103-3010)
This repository contains raw data for the course assignments.

## My strengths as a leader
Assignment contained making three lists; self-assessment, peer feedback, and theory; and comparing these three lists to fill Johari's window.

### Self-assessment
The following strenghts came first to my mind and I stopped on the tenth item due to assignment was to write the words that came to mind under 10 minutes. So the words I discovered in less that 10 minutes in no particular order: Open, Honest, Presence, Good listener, Empathic, Fair, Authentic, Easy to approach to, Helpful, Optimism.

### Peer feedback
I asked feedback from my team lead, current and former team members, and few other close colleagues (total of 19 people, 7 of who replied). The following words were used when describing my strenghts: Clear and encouraging communication, Clarity, Approachable and accessible, Ease of working with, Knowledge and professional skills, Fair, Fareness, Compassion, Understandable and helpful, Helpful & Cooperative, Supportive and helpful mentor, Guidance, Openness, Positive attitude, Good humour, Fun, Organization and leadership, Tranquility, and Follows up on what has been promised. After listing all the words used, I tried to categorize them a bit to find possible synonyms. My final list of peer feedback strenths I used in the reporting were: Clarity, Easy to approach to, Expertise, Fair, Good listener, Helpful, Open, Positivity, Presence, Tranquility, and Trustworthy.

### Theory
After checking multiple options I decided to this time use Path-Goal Theory as a reference point. Theory is presented on our course book's (Dugan, J. 2017. Leadership Theory) chapter 5. Words that describe leader in the path-goal theory, at least from my point of view what I understood, are following: Clear communication, Emotional intelligence, Empathic, Engage, Goal-oriented, Good listener, Hierarchical, Inclusive, Motivational, Situational awareness, and Trustworthy.

### Quick summary
