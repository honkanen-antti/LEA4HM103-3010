# My leadership manifesto
Mostly to remind myself but also to other leaders in expert organizations (especially consultancy organizations), I’ve built this manifesto to give guidance and strength whenever leadership seems overwhelming. To everyone, looking to succeed in leadership, I wish you best of luck and hope these words soothe your anxiety and give you hope of better tomorrow. This manifesto is based on shared leadership, situational leadership, and servant leadership theories.

As Dugan (2017, 170–171) describes, shared leadership extends capabilities of hierarchical theories by providing way for the groups to take accountability from achieving their goals supporting each other on the way. Supervisors cannot always be there and as supervisors we should train our people to take responsibility when needed. C.S. Lewis famously said, “Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching” and that’s what we should teach to our people. We cannot or shouldn’t be there all the time watching, we need to trust people do the right thing even when we aren’t there.

Situational leadership stresses the importance of developing leadership style from directing to coaching to supporting and finally to delegating (Dugan 2017, 128–130). By adjusting your leadership style based on the follower’s abilities for the given task, you can guide them towards growth. We’re all unique individuals, and we all have unique set of skills, that’s why we all need different kind of guidance on our way. As does technology evolve, so do we, and so it’s mandatory for us to also change the way we lead individuals through their growth.

In servant leadership motivation to lead comes from personal desire to serve others, hence leaders are servants first, and leaders second (Dugan 2017, 201–203). Intention of serving is to give people chance to grow and help them succeed, and in consulting business this is crucial to future proof the business. Steve Jobs once said, “It doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do”. This relates to servant leadership in a way that we should help smart people do their job in best possible way, instead of telling them exactly what to do. We’re here to guide and serve people.

Situational leadership and servant leadership share the importance of individual’s needs which affects the communication ways and actions taken. Shared leadership includes to these theories through its nature of “influence arising from any direction in a group” (Dugan 2017, 169). All three theories support each other’s in consultancy business where we work in multiple teams.

Manifesto:
* We are all responsible for taking care of each other as shared leadership theory suggests. We aren’t a family, but a tightly collaborative community, working together towards common goal.
* By working together and helping others, we leave no heart behind and can deliver best possible outcome to our customers.
* Knowledge is to be shared, so let’s share our knowledge to each other’s so that everyone feels empowered to do what it takes. We are here to serve each other’s.
* Giving answers is quick way to handle inquiries, but you aren’t Google, coach instead. If coaching isn’t enough, try mentoring. If that isn’t enough, teach. Remember that situational leadership encourages you to transform from directing to coaching to supporting and eventually to delegating (Dugan 2017, 130).
* Take care of your wellbeing so you have strength to take care of others also. You cannot serve others if you don’t have the strength to carry yourself. As in airplanes, put the oxygen mask to yourself first before helping others.
